class Dispersion(BaseDispersion):
    r"""
    Maier-Saupe dispersion on orientation (equal weights).

    .. math:

        w(\theta) = e^{a{\cos^2 \theta}}

    This provides a close match to the gaussian distribution for
    low angles, but the tails are limited to $\pm 90^\circ$.  For $a \ll 1$
    the distribution is approximately uniform.  The usual polar coordinate
    projection applies, with $\theta$ weights scaled by $\cos \theta$
    and $\phi$ weights unscaled.

    This is equivalent to a cyclic gaussian distribution
    $w(\theta) = e^{-sin^2(\theta)/(2\sigma^2)}.

    The $\theta$ points are spaced such that each interval has an
    equal contribution to the distribution.

    This works surprisingly poorly.  Try::

        $ sascomp cylinder -2d theta=45 phi=20 phi_pd_type=maier_saupe_eq \
          phi_pd_n=100,1000 radius=50 length=2*radius -midq phi_pd=5

    Leaving it here for others to improve.
