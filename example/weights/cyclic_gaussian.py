    Cyclic gaussian dispersion on orientation.

    .. math:

        w(\theta) = e^{-\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{2 \sigma^2}}

    This provides a close match to the gaussian distribution for
    low angles, but the tails are limited to $\pm 90^\circ$.  For $\sigma$
    large the distribution is approximately uniform.  The usual polar coordinate
    projection applies, with $\theta$ weights scaled by $\cos \theta$
    and $\phi$ weights unscaled.

    This is eqivalent to a Maier-Saupe distribution with order
    parameter $a = 1/(2 \sigma^2)$, with $\sigma$ in radians.
