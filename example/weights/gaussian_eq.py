class Dispersion(BaseDispersion):

    Gaussian dispersion, with 1-$\sigma$ width.

    .. math::

        w = \exp\left(-\tfrac12 (x - c)^2/\sigma^2\right)

    $x$ points are chosen such that each interval has equal weight.

    This works surprisingly poorly.  Try::

        $ sascomp cylinder -2d theta=45 phi=20 phi_pd_type=gaussian_eq \
          phi_pd_n=100,1000 radius=50 length=2*radius -midq phi_pd=5

    Leaving it here for others to improve.
