Calculates the scattering from a **body-centered cubic lattice** with
paracrystalline distortion. Thermal vibrations are considered to be negligible,
and the size of the paracrystal is infinitely large. Paracrystalline distortion
is assumed to be isotropic and characterized by a Gaussian distribution.

The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V_p} V_\text{lattice} P(q) Z(q)


where *scale* is the volume fraction of spheres, $V_p$ is the volume of the
primary particle, $V_\text{lattice}$ is a volume correction for the crystal
structure, $P(q)$ is the form factor of the sphere (normalized), and $Z(q)$
is the paracrystalline structure factor for a body-centered cubic structure.

Equation (1) of the 1990 reference\ [#CIT1990]_ is used to calculate $Z(q)$,
using equations (29)-(31) from the 1987 paper\ [#CIT1987]_ for $Z1$, $Z2$, and
$Z3$.

The lattice correction (the occupied volume of the lattice) for a
body-centered cubic structure of particles of radius $R$ and nearest neighbor
separation $D$ is

.. math::

    V_\text{lattice} = \frac{16\pi}{3} \frac{R^3}{\left(D\sqrt{2}\right)^3}


The distortion factor (one standard deviation) of the paracrystal is included
in the calculation of $Z(q)$

.. math::

    \Delta a = g D

where $g$ is a fractional distortion based on the nearest neighbor distance.

    Body-centered cubic lattice.

For a crystal, diffraction peaks appear at reduced q-values given by

.. math::

    \frac{qD}{2\pi} = \sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}

where for a body-centered cubic lattice, only reflections where
$(h + k + l) = \text{even}$ are allowed and reflections where
$(h + k + l) = \text{odd}$ are forbidden. Thus the peak positions
correspond to (just the first 5)

.. math::

    \begin{array}{lccccc}
    q/q_o          &   1   & \sqrt{2} & \sqrt{3} & \sqrt{4} & \sqrt{5} \\
    \text{Indices} & (110) &    (200) & (211)    & (220)    & (310)    \\
    \end{array}

**NB**: The calculation of $Z(q)$ is a double numerical integral that must
be carried out with a high density of points to properly capture the sharp
peaks of the paracrystalline scattering. So be warned that the calculation
is SLOW. Go get some coffee. Fitting of any experimental data must be
resolution smeared for any meaningful fit. This makes a triple integral.
Very, very slow. Go get lunch!

This example dataset is produced using 200 data points,
*qmin* = 0.001 |Ang^-1|, *qmax* = 0.1 |Ang^-1| and the above default values.

The 2D (Anisotropic model) is based on the reference below where $I(q)$ is
approximated for 1d scattering. Thus the scattering pattern for 2D may not
be accurate.
