Definition
----------

Calculates the scattering from a **simple cubic lattice** with
paracrystalline distortion. Thermal vibrations are considered to be
negligible, and the size of the paracrystal is infinitely large.
Paracrystalline distortion is assumed to be isotropic and characterized
by a Gaussian distribution.

The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = \text{scale}\frac{V_\text{lattice}P(q)Z(q)}{V_p} + \text{background}

where scale is the volume fraction of spheres, $V_p$ is the volume of the
primary particle, $V_\text{lattice}$ is a volume correction for the crystal
structure, $P(q)$ is the form factor of the sphere (normalized), and $Z(q)$
is the paracrystalline structure factor for a simple cubic structure.

Equation (16) of the 1987 reference\ [#Matsuoka1987]_ is used to calculate
$Z(q)$, using equations (13)-(15) from the 1987 paper\ [#Matsuoka1990]_ for
$Z1$, $Z2$, and $Z3$.

The lattice correction (the occupied volume of the lattice) for a simple cubic
structure of particles of radius *R* and nearest neighbor separation *D* is

.. math::

    V_\text{lattice}=\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{R^3}{D^3}

The distortion factor (one standard deviation) of the paracrystal is included
in the calculation of $Z(q)$

.. math::

    \Delta a = gD

where *g* is a fractional distortion based on the nearest neighbor distance.

The simple cubic lattice is

For a crystal, diffraction peaks appear at reduced q-values given by

.. math::

    \frac{qD}{2\pi} = \sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}

where for a simple cubic lattice any h, k, l are allowed and none are
forbidden. Thus the peak positions correspond to (just the first 5)

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{align*}
    q/q_0 \quad & \quad 1
                & \sqrt{2} \quad
                & \quad  \sqrt{3} \quad
                & \sqrt{4} \quad
                & \quad \sqrt{5}\quad \\
    Indices \quad & (100)
                  & \quad (110) \quad
                  & \quad (111)
                  & (200) \quad
                  & \quad (210)
    \end{align*}

.. note::

    The calculation of *Z(q)* is a double numerical integral that must be
    carried out with a high density of points to properly capture the sharp
    peaks of the paracrystalline scattering.
    So be warned that the calculation is slow. Fitting of any experimental data
    must be resolution smeared for any meaningful fit. This makes a triple
    integral which may be very slow.

The 2D (Anisotropic model) is based on the reference below where *I(q)* is
approximated for 1d scattering. Thus the scattering pattern for 2D may not
be accurate particularly at low $q$. For general details of the calculation
and angular dispersions for oriented particles see :ref:`orientation`.
Note that we are not responsible for any incorrectness of the
2D model computation.

    Orientation of the crystal with respect to the scattering plane, when
    $\theta = \phi = 0$ the $c$ axis is along the beam direction (the $z$ axis).
