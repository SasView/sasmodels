Calcuates the scattering from a simple star polymer with f equal Gaussian coil
arms. A star being defined as a branched polymer with all the branches
emanating from a common central (in the case of this model) point.  It is
derived as a special case of on the Benoit model for general branched
polymers\ [#CITBenoit]_ as also used by Richter *et al.*\ [#CITRichter]_

For a star with $f$ arms the scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = \frac{2}{fv^2}\left[ v-1+\exp(-v)+\frac{f-1}{2}
           \left[ 1-\exp(-v)\right]^2\right]

where

.. math:: v=\frac{uf}{(3f-2)}

and

.. math:: u = \left\langle R_{g}^2\right\rangle q^2

contains the square of the ensemble average radius-of-gyration of the full
polymer while v contains the radius of gyration of a single arm $R_{arm}$.
The two are related as:

.. math:: R_{arm}^2 = \frac{f}{3f-2} R_{g}^2

Note that when there is only one arm, $f = 1$, the Debye Gaussian coil
equation is recovered.

.. note::
   Star polymers in solutions tend to have strong interparticle and osmotic
   effects. Thus the Benoit equation may not work well for many real cases.
   A newer model for star polymer incorporating excluded volume has been
   developed by Li et al in arXiv:1404.6269 [physics.chem-ph].  Also, at small
   $q$ the scattering, i.e. the Guinier term, is not sensitive to the number of
   arms, and hence 'scale' here is simply $I(q=0)$ as described for the
   :ref:`mono-gauss-coil` model, using volume fraction $\phi$ and volume V
   for the whole star polymer.
