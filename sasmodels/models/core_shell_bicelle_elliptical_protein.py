Adds an elliptical rod shaped "protein" through the center of 
core_shell_bicelle_elliptical_belt_rough
The protein sticks out beyond the face of the bicelle, on BOTH faces, 
by distance thick_protein. The whole particle remains centrosymmetric.
The assymetric case, where the protein sticks out further on one face 
than the other is not yet possible in sasview,as that will require a 
completely different I(Q) calculation involving complex algebra.

NOTE it is up to the user to keep the elliptical protein cross section
inside the elliptical core of the bicelle, else non-physical results will
be produced!

   Schematic cross section of core_shell_bicelle_elliptical_protein. Users
   will have to decide how to distribute "heads" and "tails" between the
   rim, face and core regions in order to estimate appropriate starting
   parameters.

The scattering length densities (sld) are: $\rho_c$, the core, $\rho_f$,
the face, $\rho_r$, the rim, $\rho_p$, the protein,  and $\rho_s$ the solvent.

The form factor for the protein containing bicelle is calculated in cylindrical
coordinates, where
$\alpha$ is the angle between the $Q$ vector and the cylinder axis, and $\psi$
is the angle for the ellipsoidal cross section core, to give:

.. math::

    I(Q,\alpha,\psi) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V_t}
        \cdot F(Q,\alpha, \psi)^2 \cdot \sin(\alpha)
        \cdot\exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}Q^2\sigma^2 \right\} + \text{background}

where a numerical integration of $F(Q,\alpha, \psi)^2\sin(\alpha)$ is
carried out over $\alpha$ and $\psi$ for:

.. math::

    F(Q,\alpha,\psi) = &\bigg[
      (\rho_c -\rho_r - \rho_f + \rho_s) V_c
      \frac{2J_1(QR'\sin \alpha)}{QR'\sin\alpha}
      \frac{\sin(Q(L/2)\cos\alpha)}{Q(L/2)\cos\alpha} \\
    &+(\rho_f - \rho_s) V_{c+f}
      \frac{2J_1(QR'\sin\alpha)}{QR'\sin\alpha}
      \frac{\sin(Q(L/2+t_f)\cos\alpha)}{Q(L/2+t_f)\cos\alpha} \\
    &+(\rho_r - \rho_s) V_{c+r}
      \frac{2J_1(Q(R'+t_r)\sin\alpha)}{Q(R'+t_r)\sin\alpha} 
      \frac{\sin(Q(L/2)\cos\alpha)}{Q(L/2)\cos\alpha} \\
    &+\bigg((\rho_p - \rho_s) V_p\frac{\sin(Q(L/2 +t_f +t_p)\cos\alpha)}{Q(L/2 +t_f +t_p)\cos\alpha} \\
    &+(\rho_s - \rho_f) V_d\frac{\sin(Q(L/2 +t_f)\cos\alpha)}{Q(L/2 +t_f)\cos\alpha} \\
    &+(\rho_f - \rho_c) V_e\frac{\sin(Q(L/2)\cos\alpha)}{Q(L/2)\cos\alpha} \bigg)
    \frac{2J_1(QR'_p\sin\alpha)}{QR'_p\sin\alpha}\bigg]

where

.. math::

    R' = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}
        \sqrt{(1+X_\text{core}^{2}) + (1-X_\text{core}^{2})\cos(\psi)} \\
    R'_p = \frac{R_p}{\sqrt{2}}
        \sqrt{(1+X_\text{protein}^{2}) + (1-X_\text{protein}^{2})\cos(\psi)}


and $V_t = \pi (R+t_r)(X_\text{core} R+t_r) L + 2 \pi X_\text{core} R^2 t_f+2\pi X_\text{protein}R_p^2 thick_\text{protein}$ is
the total volume of the bicelle plus any protein sticking out from the faces,
$V_c = \pi X_\text{core} R^2 L$ the volume of
the core, $V_{c+f} = \pi X_\text{core} R^2 (L+2 t_f)$ the volume of the core
plus the volume of the faces, $V_{c+r} = \pi (R+t_r)(X_\text{core} R+t_r) L$
the volume of the core plus the rim, $V_d = \pi X_\text{protein} R_p^2 (L+2t_f)$ is the
volume of protein intersecting the bicelle, $V_e = \pi X_\text{protein} R_p^2 L$ is the
volume of protein intersecting the core of the bicelle.

$R$ is the radius of the core,
$X_\text{core}$ is the axial ratio of the core, $L$ the length of the core,
$t_f$ the thickness of the face, $t_r$ the thickness of the rim and $J_1$ the
usual first order bessel function. The bicelle core has radii $R$ and $X_\text{core} R$
so is circular, as for the core_shell_bicelle model, for $X_\text{core}=1$.
Note that you may need to limit the range of $X_\text{core}$, especially if
using the Monte-Carlo algorithm, as setting radius to $R/X_\text{core}$ and
axial ratio to $1/X_\text{core}$ gives an equivalent solution!

$R_p$ is the radius of the protein,
$X_\text{protein}$ is the axial ratio of the protein, which has total length $L+2t_f+2thick_\text{protein}$.
The axes of the elliptical cross section protein cylinder are common with the
bicelle, so making $X_\text{protein} < 1$ whilst $X_\text{core} > 1$ can effectively
rotate the protein by 90 degrees relative to the bicelle.

An approximation for the effects of "Gaussian interfacial roughness" $\sigma$
is included, by multiplying $I(Q)$ by
$\exp\left \{ -\frac{1}{2}Q^2\sigma^2 \right \}$. This applies, in some way, to
all interfaces in the model not just the external ones. It will only work well 
when $\sigma$ is very small compared to the particle size.(Note that for a one
dimensional system convolution of the scattering length density profile with
a Gaussian of standard deviation $\sigma$ does exactly this multiplication.)
Leave $\sigma$ set to zero for the usual sharp interfaces.

The output of the 1D scattering intensity function for randomly oriented
bicelles is then given by integrating over all possible $\alpha$ and $\psi$.

For oriented bicelles the *theta*, *phi* and *psi* orientation parameters
will appear when fitting 2D data, for further details of the calculation
and angular dispersions  see :ref:`orientation` .
