Core multi-shell cylinders or discs, may be used for multi-walled tubes or
a stck of discs.

There must be a minumum of ONE shell (May set its sld to match solvent, 
thickness1 and face1 to zero or very small so the shell does not contribute 
to the normalisation volume.)

There may be numerical integration issues at extremes of Q and/or with 
extreme aspect ratios - particles 
which are very large in some dimensions compared to others.

2d scattering is so far only minimally tested.

Use of S(Q) with this model currently may not give the correct I(Q) though 
passes unit tests), due to a more general sasview v5 bug, so check carefully.

The sld profile plot show profiles along both radius and half length 
simultaneously! (A simple edit of the py code will change which is 
displayed.)

Scattering is normalised to $V_{total} = \pi.Router^2Louter$ the outer 
volume of the particle.

$Louter = length\_core + 2*(face1 + face2 + face3 + ...)$

$Router = radius\_core + thickness1 + thickness2 + thickness3 + ...$

Each new shell must completely enclose the previous ones. Setting face1, 
face2 etc. to very small values will give a multi-walled tube. By setting 
some sld\_shell to match sld\_solvent then a hollow tube or multilammellar 
tube may be generated. Conversely setting thickness1, thickness2 etc. to 
very small values will generate a stack of discs, then by setting some 
sld\_shell to match sld\_solvent a multilammellar disc stack.


.. math::

Scattered intensity is calculated by a numerical integration over angle 
$\alpha$ between the axis of the cylinder and $\vec q$,

.. math::

    I(q,\alpha) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V_{total}} F^2(q,\alpha).sin(\alpha) 
                   + \text{background}

where

.. math::

    F(q,\alpha) =  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \left[ (\rho_k - \rho_{k+1}) V_k
           \frac{\sin \left( q.h_k\cos\alpha \right)}
                {q.h_k\cos\alpha}
           \frac{2 J_1 \left( q.r_k\sin\alpha \right)}
                {q.r_k\sin\alpha} 
           \right]
           exp\left \{ -\frac{1}{2}q^2\sigma^2 \right \}

and

    $\rho_0 = sld\_core$

    $\rho_k = sld\_shell_k\quad\text{for  k = 1 to n, the number of shells}$

    $\rho_{n+1} = sld\_solvent$

    $r_0 = radius\_core$

    $r_1 = r_0 + thickness_1$

    $r_k = r_{k-1} + thickness_k\quad\text{for  k = 1 to n}$

    $h_0 = \tfrac12 length\_core$

    $h_1 = h_0 + face_1$

    $h_k = h_{k-1} + face_k\quad\text{for  k = 1 to n}$

    $V_k = 2\pi.h_k. R_k^2$

    $J_1$ is the first order Bessel function.


.. _core-multi_shell-cylinder-geometry:

.. figure:: img/core_multi_shell_cylinder_geometry.png

    Core multi_shell cylinder or disc - schematic cross section with two shells.

An approximation for the effects of "Gaussian interfacial roughness" $\sigma$
is included, by multiplying $I(Q)$ by
$\exp\left \{ -\frac{1}{2}Q^2\sigma^2 \right \}$. This applies to
all interfaces in the model not just the external ones. (Note that for a one
dimensional system convolution of the scattering length density profile with
a Gaussian of standard deviation $\sigma$ does exactly this multiplication.)
To work well $\sigma$ must be much smaller than the particle size. 
Leave $\sigma$ set to zero for the usual sharp interfaces.
There is some debate as to whether the factor of 1/2 is needed or not.

Since the number of parameters may become too large to fit well, fix or 
constrain as many as possible. e.g. to constrain face1 to thickness1, 
click on the first, ctrl/click the second, right click and select 
"mutual constraint". Note that such constraints are NOT applied inside
integrations over polydispersity, they are only applied to starting values.
To do this the constraints would need to be included inside a customized model.


To provide easy access to the orientation of the core-shell cylinder, we
define the axis of the cylinder using two angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.
(see :ref:`cylinder model <cylinder-angle-definition>`)


The $\theta$ and $\phi$ parameters are not used for the 1D output.
