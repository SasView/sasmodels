This model calculates the structure factor, $S(q)$, of one-component liquid
systems interacting with a two-term Yukawa potential with the mean spherical
approximation (MSA) by solving the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation. Both Yukawa
terms can be used to simulate either a repulsive or an attraction potential
feature. For example, if one Yukawa term is chosen to be an attractive potential
and the other a repulsive potential, the two Yukawa potential can simulate a
potential with both a short-range attraction and long-range repulsion
(SALR).[1,2] When combined with an appropriate form factor $P(q)$, this allows
for inclusion of the interparticle interference effects due to a relatively
complex potential.

The algorithm used in this model was originally proposed and developed by Liu et
al. in 2005 and implemented using MatLab.[1] This algorithm used a theory
proposed by Hoye and Blum in 1977,[4] in which the structure factor is solved by
using Baxter's Q-method with the MSA closure.

The interaction potential $V(r)$ is

.. math::

    \frac{V(r)}{k_BT} = \begin{cases}
    \infty & r < 1 \\
    K_1 \frac{e^{-Z_1(r-1)}}{r} + K_2 \frac{e^{-Z_2(r-1)}}{r} & r \geq 1
    \end{cases}

where $r$ is the normalized distance, $\frac{r_{cc}}{2R}$. ($R$ is the effective
radius and $r_{cc}$ is the distance between the center-of-mass of particles.)
$K_1$ and $K_2$ are positive for repulsion and negative for attraction.
$Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the inversely proportional to the decay rate of the
potential. They should always be positive.

To reduce numerical issues during fitting, the lower boundary of the absolute
values for $K_1$ and $K_2$ are set to 0.0001. That is, when $|K| < 0.0001$ it is
adjusted 0.0001 while preserving the sign. Similarly, when $Z_1$ or $Z_2$ are
less than 0.01, they are adjusted to 0.01. To make the two Yukawa terms
functionally different, $Z_1$ is adjusted to $Z_2+0.01$ if the difference
between them is less than 0.01. The impact of these changes on the accuracy of
$S(Q)$ was negligible for all tested cases. The algorithm works best if
$Z_1>Z_2$, particularly for large $Z$ such as $Z>20$. When $Z_1$ is less than
$Z_2$, the code will automatically swap $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, and $K_1$ and $K_2$.
$S(Q)$ is set to 1.0 for volume fraction $\phi < 10^{-10}$.

.. note::

    The so-called $\beta(q)$ ("beta") approximation [3] can be used
    to calculate the effective structure factor for polydispersity and
    non-sphericity when a system is not too far away from the mono-disperse
    spherical systems.

In general, any closure used to solve the OZ equation is an approximation. Thus,
the structure factor calculated using a closure is an approximation of the real
structure factor. Its accuracy varies for different parameter ranges. One should
not "blindly" trust the results. In addition, when using the O-Z equation to
obtain the structure factor, it assumes that a system is in a liquid state.
However, when the attraction potential is too strong the system may not be in a
simple liquid state, and the OZ equation may not have a solution, or the
solution may be unphysical.

Accuracy for the MSA closure used here to solve the OZ equation for two Yukawa
potential was evaluated by Broccio, et al.[2]  When the overall attraction is
moderate, this algorithm produces reasonably accurate results. However, when the
net attraction is very strong, it has been shown that the fitting algorithm
tends to overestimate the attraction strength. Care is needed when discussing
quantitative fitting results for those systems.

When the interaction distances $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are large, the method implemented
here may be influenced by the numerical accuracy of a computer. In general, when
$Z<20$, the code should function well for most cases. When $Z>25$, sometimes the
intermediate results of this code may run into the limit of the largest number
that a computer can handle. Therefore, results may potentially become less
reliable. Hence, the check of $g(r)$ becomes very important in those situations.
So far, no limitation of the value of $K$ has been encountered except that they
cannot be zero.
